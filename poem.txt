//Author - CX-CuriosityX
I am writing this first line of my poem. 
I will track this line and commit this line now. 
Any new change must start with two newline character and with the author.

I am adding a new line to see if the file goes to modified state. Now it is unmodified.


I am making this change to see if git is able to show me the correct difference.


Again making changes I was not able to follow the earlier change


--The positive way branch --
Eveything will be good.
